# Introduction to React
## 1. Init React
Prerequisite of that step is to have nodejs installed on your machine.
- Execute `npx create-react-app introduction-to-react --template typescript` to create a new react project using typescript
- After the initialization is complete, you can navigate to the project directory with `cd introduced-react`
- Here you can run your project for the first time with `npm start`, all necessary npm packages are already installed. If you add a new package you need to run `npm install`
- Hot reloading in React is a development feature that automatically updates the application with code changes in real-time, providing a faster feedback loop and preserving the current state of the application.
